* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:checkDebugAarMetadata'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.CheckAarMetadataWorkAction

       1.  Dependency 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.15.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 35 or later of the
           Android APIs.
     
           :app is currently compiled against android-34.
     
           Also, the maximum recommended compile SDK version for Android Gradle
           plugin 8.2.1 is 34.
     
           Recommended action: Update this project's version of the Android Gradle
           plugin to one that supports 35, then update this project to use
           compileSdk of at least 35.
     
           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
